# Tiled-Interactive-Media-Browser
Unity-built interactive tiled media browser for up to 16 videos. Automatic tile randomization, idle screen saver and full screen play-mode all included.
Note: AVPro Plugin required. You must name 16 videos "1.mp4", "2.mp4", ... , "16.mp4" and create tiles in the scene for each thumbnail (and separate thumbnails with a playbutton overlayed, if desired, for  when the user taps a video from the main menu).
